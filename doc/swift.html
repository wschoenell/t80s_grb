<hr>

<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
The GCN system has been modified to incorporate the distribution
of positions of GRBs (and non-GRB transients) detected by the Swift spacecraft
(all 3 instruments) plus the images, spectra, and lightcurve information.
<p>
About 2-3 times a week, there will be a GRB (or transient) in the FOV (field of view)
of the BAT instrument that is bright enough to be localized.
Swift transmits these BAT localizations through the TDRS system (Tracking & Data Relay Satellite)
to the ground within ~20 sec after the BAT trigger (there can also be
an XRT Position (and UVOT position) ~100 sec later).
If that burst position meets the site's filtering criteria, then it gets that Notice.
<p>
Like all the other sources of GRB/transient information within the GCN system,
users can elect to receive (or not) each of these Swift Notice types.
<p>
There are 27 different types of of information from the Swift mission -- this is
about an order of magnitude more than any previous mission.  And since some of these
Notices are of a sufficiently different type of content than previous missions
(ie images, spectra),
people may need to study this web page carefully to determine
which types are suitable for their specific operation.
All the GCN/Swift Notices are archived within the GCN website
in the <a href="swift_grbs.html">Table of Swift GRBs</a>.
<p>
<a name="tc2"></a>
<b>Notice Types, Content, and Purpose</b>
<p>
There are 27 (17 raw + 5 processed + 3 special + 2 misc) GCN/Swift Notice types.<br>
They are:<br>
<a name="tc2a"></a>
<p>
1)  <b>BAT_Alert Notice</b> starts the sequence of messages.<br>
    It occurs when the BAT instrument first triggers<br>
    (either a rate trigger or an image trigger).<br>
    It does NOT contain an RA,Dec location of a  burst;<br>
    only a date, time, and trigger criteria & trigger detection significance.<br>
    It is issued only once per trigger, (but may not be present for all triggers<br>
    if there is TDRSS bit/frame sync-up delay -- that's the reason the Alerts exist,<br>
    to start the TDRSS sync-up process so it's ready by the time<br>
    the BAT_Pos Notice comes along).<br>
    Since they are available 6-30 sec before the BAT_Position Notice,<br>
    they can be used by robotic telescopes<br>
    as a heads-up to abort any on-going observation activity.<br>
    The SWIFT_BAT_ALERT is currently NOT being sent to the TDRSS transmitter,<br>
    so there is never any to receive and distribute through GCN.<br>
    This is because the original motivation for it no longer exists.  Swift is now operating the TDRSS transmitter<br>
     in a 24/7 mode, so the transmitter is always "warm" and always sync-ed.<br>
<a name="tc2aba"></a>
<p>
2a) <b>BAT_Quicklook_Position Notice</b> contains the RA,Dec location for the burst detected by BAT.<br>
    They are issued only once per burst, but for only ~90% of the triggers.<br>
    They are available 0-6 sec (ave of 3 sec) before the regular BAT_Position notice.<br>
    The time delays are about 7-30 sec after the Trigger Time (only 0.2 sec of that is due to GCN).<br>
    They contain a subset of the information in a regular BAT_Position notice.<br>
    They are available ONLY to socket sites -- they are NOT available to email-based sites.
<a name="tc2b"></a>
<p>
2a) <b>BAT_Position Notice</b> contains the RA,Dec location for the burst detected by BAT.<br>
    They are issued only once per burst.<br>
    The time delays are about 7-30 sec after the Trigger Time (only 0.1 sec of that is due to GCN).<br>
    If the on-board flight software cannot locate a burst,<br>
    then this Position Notice will be replaced with a Pos_Nack Notice (see 2b).<br>
    The Position Notice comes second in the sequence of Notices on the triggers/bursts.<br>
    Since the position is based on the least-possible amount of data in the processing<br>
    (just a small initial portion of the burst's lightcurve),<br>
    it has the lowest significance in the localization process.  Even so,<br>
    the uncertainty in the position is 3arcmin for the at-threshold bursts<br>
    and 1arcmin for the bright bursts. (Both the 'at-threshold' and 'bright'<br>
    refer to only the amount of photons in the time interval of the trigger-sampling interval <br>
    of the burst lightcurve.)<br>
    The trigger time listed in the Notice (ie the GRB_TIME) can be off by +/- 320 msec<br>
    for events that have a trigger duration less than 64 msec.  This has to do with the way<br>
    that the flight software is optimized for execution speed for evaluating the shortest trigger criteria.<br>
    It should be noted that even though this Notice type is called the<br>
    BAT_GRB_POSITION, it does also contain detections of hard x-ray transients.<br>
    There is both flight- and ground-software in place to correctly identify<br>
    bursts from transients, but this identification is not 100% perfect.<br>
	There is also a RETRACTION form of the BAT_POS Notice.  If, after ground-processing<br>
	with humans-in-the-loop, the initial "burst" identification is determined to be incorrect,<br>
	then a Retraction will be issued.<br>
    The combination of the flight s/w identification code and the ground-processing identification code<br>
    is 98% accurate (i.e. only 2% false positives: said it was a real GRB when it was not).<br>
    <u>SubThreshold Variation</u>:<br>
    After 4 years of on-orbit operations, a new Notice type was added: the SubThreshold Position.<br>
    The content and function of this type is identical to the regular BAT_Position type.<br>
    The only difference is that these notices result from triggers with S/N levels<br>
    below the normal 6.5 sigma (image domain) threshold level.<br>
    The motivation for this new type is to lower the BAT threshold to see if fainter bursts<br>
    can be found (at the cost of an obviously higher false-positive rate).<br>
    This was discontnued after about 6 months by the Swift Team because of Swift operational problems.<br>
<a name="tc2c"></a>
<p>
2b) <b>BAT_Position_Nack Notice</b> does NOT contain an RA,Dec location for the burst.<br>
    If the BAT on-board software can not determine a location<br>
    (even after repeated attempts, trying many different trigger criteria)<br>
    then a Pos_Nack Notice will be sent (in place of the Pos Notice).<br>
    This type of Notice comes second in the sequence of Notices on the trigger/burst.<br>
    This is the last Notice in the sequence -- the sequence stops with BAT_Pos_Nack.<br>
    Currently, BAT does not forward this message type to the TDRSS transmitter,<br>
    so these are not received on the ground and GCN can not distribute them.<br>
    This is OK, because it turns out that in practice they have no value<br>
    for the follow-up community -- only for the instrument operations team.<br>
<a name="tc2d"></a>
<p>
2c) <b>BAT_Position Update Notice</b> Under rare circumstances, an updated RA,Dec position.<br>
    Notice can be issued.  If, after ground-processing with humans-in-the-loop,<br>
	the location moves by more than 2-3 arcmin from the on-board location<br>
    and no XRT_Position notice was available,<br>
	then an UPDATE Position Notice will be generated and distributed.<br>
	(Note it has been 5 years into the mission and no Updates have been issued,<br>
	so this subtype is rare indeed. It was intended for the human-in-the-loop early-ops<br>
    varification phase when we might have needed to issue an update.)<br>
<a name="tc2e"></a>
<p>
2d) <b>BAT_Transient Notice</b> BAT does not always trigger on GRBs.  Sometimes<br>
    it triggers on other types of astrophysical sources (eg LMXBs, HMXB, Flare stars, etc).<br>
	Each location is compared to both on-board and ground catalogs of known sources.<br>
	When there is a match (with in 0.3 deg) to a known source, then the trigger<br>
	is reclassified as a Transient (instead of a GRB) and a BAT_Transient Notice is issued.<br>
	(Note that the same trigger also goes out as a "BAT GRB Notice" with the catalog ID<br>
	noted in the Comments section.  That is to say, the BAT_GRB_POS notice is issued<br>
    for all BAT triggers, but the BAT_TRANS_POS is notice is issued only for those triggers<br>
    that get classified as astrophysical-but-non-GRB in origin.)<br>
<a name="tc2f"></a>
<p>
3)  <b>BAT_Lightcurve Notice</b> contains a 209.92-sec interval of the count rates<br>
    from the Detector Array (in 4 energy bands).  The time-sampling varies throughout<br>
    the lightcurve -- finer sampling around the trigger and coarser sampling well before the trigger and<br>
    well after the trigger.<br>
    The email-form of delivery method can also optionally have the lightcurve<br>
    as an attachment (see the Table in the Formts section below).<br>
    They also contain the exact same RA,Dec location as the BAT_Position Notice.<br>
    They are issued only once per burst/transient.<br>
    An <a href=bat_lc_example.jpeg>example</a> of a BAT Lightcurve.<br>
    This lightcurve can be used to determine the length of the burst,<br>
    and the complexity (eg single vs multiple peaks, FREDs, spikes, precursors, etc).<br>
    Caution should be used in interpretting these TDRSS Lightcurves, because<br>
    background has NOT been subtracted and because steady sources are coming into<br>
    and out of the BAT FOV as the s/c slews to the new burst position.<br>
<a name="tc2g"></a>
<p>
4)  <b>FOM_Observe Notice</b> indicates whether or not the Figure of Merit (FOM) calculation (done on-board) determined<br>
    if this burst was worth observing (ie becoming the next Automated Target (AT)).<br>
    If so, then a slew_request is sent to the spacecraft.<br>
    (The FOM_OBSERVE is only a merit-based decision;<br>
    the slew-decision is communicated in the next Notice Type.)<br>
    They contain a copy of the burst BAT_Position RA,Dec location, time, etc.<br>
    They are issued only once per burst.<br>
<a name="tc2h"></a>
<p>
5)  <b>SC_Slew Notice</b> indicates whether or not the spacecraft determined<br>
    if it was safe to slew to this new Automated Target location.<br>
    If none of the 4 observing constraints are violated during the projected slew path,<br>
    then the s/c will slew,<br>
    else the slew may be delayed (1-2500 sec; until the burst RA,Dec location comes out of constraint), or<br>
    else it may never happen (it is technically possible for BAT to detect a burst that is not observable<br>
    by the NFIs).<br>
    The SC_Slew notice contains a copy of the burst BAT RA,Dec location, time, etc.<br>
    They are issued once or twice per burst.  The second occurance happens when the initial detection<br>
	is violating an observing constraint for the NFIs (about 1 in 10 bursts have this occurance).<br>
	Then a second SC_Slew Notice will be issued at the time when the location comes out of observing constraint<br>
	and the s/c slews to the new target.<br>
<a name="tc2i"></a>
<p>
6a) <b>XRT_Position Notice</b> contains an RA,Dec location for the burst/afterglow as determined by XRT.<br>
    They are issued only once per burst (or never -- see XRT_Pos_Nack).<br>
    The time delay is 80 to 150 sec (the AT slew response time of the spacecraft).<br>
    The position comes from the XRT flight software<br>
    scanning the initial quicklook image taken immediately after the slew to the new AT burst/transient.<br>
    If the on-board determination was a Nack, then ground-processing with humans-in-the-loop,<br>
	an XRT_Position Notice can be generated and distributed (time delay ~10-30 min).<br>
	There is also a RETRACTION form of the XRT_POS Notice.  If, after ground-processing<br>
	with humans-in-the-loop, the initial "burst" identification is determined to be incorrect<br>
    (eg ob-board s/w locked onto a cosmic ray hit or a known steady state source),<br>
	then a Retraction will be issued.<br>
<a name="tc2j"></a>
<p>
6b) <b>XRT_Position_Nack Notice</b> does NOT contain an RA,Dec location for the burst.<br>
    If the XRT on-board software was not able to find a point source in its initial image,<br>
    it will try up to 11 more times (11 more images and scannings for a point-source);<br>
    if after the 12th attempt and still no point-source, then it issues this Pos_Nack message.<br>
    In the total Swift message sequence, there will be either an XRT_Pos or an XRT_Pos_Nack, but never both.<br>
    When the XRT_Pos_Nack is issued, there will be no XRT_Image Notice in the sequence,<br>
    but there will still be XRT_Spectrum and XRT_Lightcurve Notices issued.<br>
    (This XRT_Pos_Nack is called the Centroid_Error message within the XRT documentation.)<br>
<a name="tc2k"></a>
<p>
6c) <b>XRT_Position Update Notice</b> contain an updated/improved RA,Dec position.<br>
    Notice can be issued.  If, after automated ground-processing (or with humans-in-the-loop),<br>
	the location moves by more than about 3-4 arcsec from the on-board location,<br>
	then an UPDATE Position Notice will be generated and distributed.<br>
    Initially these wre rare, but after a couple years of operations,<br>
    the occurance rates is about 1 in 2 bursts.  The position uncertainty<br>
    usually shrinks significantly as well.  These are issued within 10-30 minutes.<br>
<a name="tc2l"></a>
<p>
7)  <b>XRT_Image Notice</b> contains a 2x2arcmin (51x51 pixel subarray)<br>
    of the full 23.6 arcmin diameter FOV centered on the position found in the XRT_Pos Notice.<br>
    (This subarray comes from the actual CCD integration that was used for the XRT_Pos determination.)<br>
    The integration duration can be 0.1sec or 2.5sec.<br>
    They are issued only once per burst, but will not be present if no XRT Position was found<br>
    (ie XRT_Pos_Nack).<br>
    The email Notice contains the actual image only if the recipient has elected to receive<br>
    the image as an attachment to the email format -- the image can always be obtained<br>
    from the URL contained in the body of the email Notice.<br>
    An <a href=xrt_image_example.html>example</a> of an XRT Image.<br>
<a name="tc2m"></a>
<p>
8)  <b>XRT_Spectrum Notice</b> contains a raw spectrum of the photons collected across the FOV<br>
    ie point-source photons plus non-point-source photons are also included.<br>
    There are 2 types of spectra: LRPD (Low Rate PhotoDiode, mode 5), and<br>
    WT (Windowed Timing, mode 6).  The amount of time that goes into the accumulations<br>
    depends on the intensity of the source (and therefore the readout mode of the CCD).<br>
    The pair of spectra are issued only once per burst; even the ones that result in an XRT_Pos_Nack.<br>
    The XRT flight software issues two seprate spectral messages, and<br>
    there is only one spectum per Notice, so the typical burst will have two XRT_Spectrum Notices;<br>
    but on some occassions, there will only be one spectrum Notice.<br>
    Each Notice contains the actual spectrum only if the recipient has elected to receive<br>
    the spectrum as an attachment to the email format -- the spectrum can always be obtained<br>
    from the URL contained in the body of the email Notice.<br>
    An <a href=xrt_spec_example.html>example</a> of an XRT Spectrum.<br>
<a name="tc2n"></a>
<p>
9)  <b>XRT_Lightcurve Notice</b> contains a lightcurve (starting at s/c_settle & after the initial image).<br>
    The duration of the lightcurve depends on (a) the afterglow flux and therefore what collection mode<br>
    the CCD is operating (LRPD, WT, or PC), and (b) any of the pre-emptive termination conditions:<br>
    (1) time, (2) snapshot end, or (3) entry into the SAA.<br>
    The nominal length is 100 samples which translates into a 106.2 to 826 sec duration,<br>
    depending on the actual flux of the afterglow and the mode-switching sequence<br>
    used by the instrument (eg LRPD, WT, PC).<br>
    They are issued only once per burst, even the ones that result in an XRT_Pos_Nack.<br>
    The email Notice contains the actual lightcurve only if the recipient has elected to receive<br>
    the lightcurve as an attachment to the email format -- the lightcurve can always be obtained<br>
    from the URL contained in the body of the email Notice.<br>
    This is called the Prompt Lightcurve message within the XRT documentation.<br>
    An <a href=xrt_lc_example.html>example</a> of an XRT Lightcurve.<br>
<a name="tc2o"></a>
<p>
10) <b>UVOT_SourceList Notice</b> contains a list of thresholded pixel clusters<br>
    derived from scanning the initial 100-sec image immediately after the slew settles.<br>
    A pixel cluster is either a single pixel, or a 5-pixel cross, or a 5x5 subarray.<br>
    The limitation in the telemetry bandwidth (and therefore the data product size is limited)<br>
    means that not all the stars in the FOV above a given level will be contained<br>
    in the list.  The upper and lower regions of the FOV will be truncated.<br>
    Initially, they are issued only once per burst, but later in the mission<br>
    they are issued 1 to 4 times during the AT burst response (it depends on observing constraints).<br>
    The email Notice contains the actual source-list only if the recipient has elected to receive<br>
    the source-list as an attachment to the email format -- the source-list can always be obtained<br>
    from the URL contained in the body of the email Notice.<br>
    An <a href=uvot_sl_example.html>example</a> of a UVOT Source List.<br>
    (In the early days, this "source list" used to be called "finding chart",<br>
    that name was too confusing given the other UVOT Notice was much more like a finding chart.)<br>
<a name="tc2p"></a>
<p>
11) <b>UVOT_Image Notice</b> contains subarray of the full 17x17 arcmin FOV<br>
    on the best known position.  That is 80x80 pixels covering 40x40arcsec if using an XRT Postion<br>
    and 80x80 pixels covering (40x40arcsec if an XRT position is available, or<br>
    320x320arcsec if using a BAT Position).<br>
    Unlike the SourceList, this subarray has all the pixels (not thresholded clusters).<br>
    Initially, they are issued only once per burst, but later in the mission<br>
    they are issued 1 to 4 times during the AT burst response (it depends on observing constraints).<br>
    The email Notice contains the actual image only if the recipient has elected to receive<br>
    the image as an attachment to the email format -- the image can always be obtained<br>
    from the URL contained in the body of the email Notice.<br>
    An <a href=uvot_im_example.html>example</a> of a UVOT Image.<br>
    (In the early days, this "image" used to be called "dark burst" or "neighbor" or "genie",<br>
    that name was not too conotive.)<br>
<a name="tc2q"></a>
<p>
12a) <b>UVOT_Position Notice</b> contains an RA,Dec location for the burst<br>
    as determined by ground-processing software.<br>
    They are issued only once per burst, or not at all (see Nack).<br>
    The time delay is about 10 to 30 min.<br>
    Once a human has processed the UVOT data and a new source object found,<br>
    a position may be issued, if the confidence is high enough.<br>
	There is also a RETRACTION form of the UVOT_POS Notice.  If, after even more ground-processing<br>
	with humans-in-the-loop, a prior burst identification is determined to be incorrect<br>
	then a Retraction will be issued.<br>
<a name="tc2r"></a>
<p>
12b) <b>UVOT_Position_Nack Notice</b> does NOT contain an RA,Dec location for the burst.<br>
    If the ground-processing software and human analysis was not able to find a point source<br>
    then a Nack Notice is issued.<br>
    The time delay is about 10 to 30 min.<br>
    This Nack Notice contains an limiting magnitude for the UVOT observation<br>
    of the XRT error circle (or BAT error circle if XRT not available).<br>
<a name="tc2s"></a>
<p>
12c) <b>UVOT_Position Update Notice</b> Under rare circumstances, an updated RA,Dec position.<br>
    Notice can be issued.  If, after ground-processing with humans-in-the-loop,<br>
	the location moves by more than 2-3 arcsec from the on-board location,<br>
	then an UPDATE Position Notice will be generated and distributed.<br>
<p>
The next 5 Notices are ground-processed versions of some of the "raw" versions listed above:<br>
<a name="tc2t"></a>
<p>
13) <b>BAT_LIGHTCURVE_PROC</b>:  (Not yet available) Same as the "raw" Lightcurve Notice except that the changes<br>
in the background due to steady-state sources leaving and coming into the BAT FOV<br>
have been removed.  The cos(theta) effect has also been removed.<br>
This processed version of the Lightcurve Notice will not be available<br>
for the first year of the mission -- it will take the BAT Instrument team time<br>
to determine the proper correction algorithms.<br>
    An <a href=bat_lc_example.html>example</a> of a processed BAT Lightcurve.<br>
<a name="tc2u"></a>
<p>
14) <b>XRT_IMAGE_PROC</b>: ....?????......<br>
    An <a href=xrt_image_example.html>example</a> of a processed XRT Image.<br>
<a name="tc2v"></a>
<p>

    An <a href=xrt_spec_example.html>example</a> of a processed XRT Spectrum.<br>
<a name="tc2w"></a>
<p>
16) <b>UVOT_SRCLIST_PROC</b>:  The raw image converted into 4 "processed" data products:<br>
a) ???some form of the original image????<br>
b) the list of source objects found in the Source List,<br>
c) the list of source objects correlated (matched up) with the Hubble GuideStar Catalog (HGSC).<br>
d) a "prettified" image containing the HGSC objects labeled and RA,Dec gridlines drawn in, and<br>
the BAT and XRT error circles overlayed.<br>
    If you elect to receive the email form and to receive attachments, this Notice<br>
    will have 4 attachments per email Notice.<br>

The next 4 Notice types are in the special category:<br>
<br>
<a name="tc2x2"></a>
18) <b>BAT_Slew_Pos Notice</b> is identical in format and content to the BAT_Pos Notice<br>
except that they are detections of bursts and transients found in the BAT Slew data.<br>
The Harvard group (Antonio Copete and Josh Grindlay) have developed automated<br>
pipeline processing on the BAT event-by-event data captured during the intervals<br>
when Swift is slewing (~75 slews per day, 100-250 sec per slew).<br>
Burst and Transient detections are sent to GCN for distribution.<br>
Time delays are 1-14 hrs.<br>
There will be about 1 "gold plated" detection per 3 months, and<br>
about 4(tbr) "silver plated" detections per month.<br>
The location uncertainties will range from 1-7 arcmin (brightest to dimmest).<br>
The BATSS processing looks for point sources in three energy ranges:<br>
Soft (15-50 keV),<br>
Hard (50-150 keV), and<br>
Broad (15-150 keV).<br>
There are 10 Trigger Criteria:<br>

19) <b>SWIFT_BAT_Monitor_Alert Notice</b> announces "outburst" increases of known sources<br>
that are routinely monitored by the BAT instrument while conducting its hard x-ray survey.<br>
When one of these sources goes into outburst and its flux increases by at least 8.0 sigma,<br>
an Alert is issued.  The Alerts contain the name of the source, the RA,Dec coordinates,<br>
the current flux and the pre-outburst baseline flux of the source (in cnts/cm2/sec), and<br>
the increase in sigma units.  A URL to the lightcurve of the source is also given (showing recent<br>
behavior and the current outburst).  Actually, in the full-format email notices the full URL is given,<br>
but in the socket packets for space limitation reasons only the unique part of the url is given.<br>
To form the full URL, you must prefix the given partial-URL with this:  http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/results/transients/ .<br>
Since the primary intended recipient of these Monitor Alerts is robotic telescopes,<br>
the threshold has been set low to get the outburst as soon as possible, but it also means<br>
that there will be some false positives.  The expected percentage is ~20%.<br>
More information about the entire Swift-BAT Hard X-ray Monitoring program<br>
can be found <a href=http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/results/transients/> here</a>.<br>

20) <b>SWIFT_BAT_SUB_SUB Notice</b> contains a location of a peak with significances in the 3.8 - 6.5 sigma range<br>
found in one of the many images made during normal operations within BAT.<br>
Individual notices are issued for each peak found in each image.<br>
More information can be found <a href=swift_sub_sub_threshold.html> here</a>.<br>
<a name="tc2zz3"></a>
<p>
21) <b>SWIFT_BAT_KNOWN Notice</b> contains locations of peaks in the image domain<br>
with locations that match sources in the on-board catalog.<br>
More information can be found <a href=swift_sub_sub_threshold.html> here</a>.<br>

<p>
The next 2 Notices are in the miscellaneous category:<br>
<br>
<a name="tc2y"></a>
22) <b>BAT_Pos_Test Notice</b> is identical in format and content to the BAT_Pos Notice<br>
except that they contain a computer-generated RA,Dec location and all the other fields.<br>
These "test" Notices are generated by the GCN computer every ~2.8 hrs.<br>
They allow the receiving site to "practice" on the BAT_Pos Notice.<br>
<a name="tc2z"></a>
<p>
23) <b>SWIFT_Pointing_Dir Notice</b> contains the next pointing direction of the s/c (bore-sight of the NFIs & BAT).<br>
It is issued 30-60 seconds before the actual slew.<br>
Obviously, only the PrePlanned Targets (PPT) targets can be "announced" with this type of Notice<br>
(the Automated Targets (ATs) can not be predicted -- they account for ~15% of the on-orbit time).<br>
This allows the recipient site to "track" the pointing direction of the s/c and<br>
therefore be that much closer to any burst detected by BAT (thereby minimizing the site's slew times).<br>
<p>

<a name="tc3"></a>
<b>Positions and Time_delays</b>
<p>
The automated on-board Swift flight software
will generate GRB notifications, positions, lightcurves, spectra, and images in real time.
(In addition, human-involved analyses of the data may sometimes result
in a revised position within a few hours after the burst.)
There is an important change from the past to be noted: the Swift socket packets
that contain RA,Dec positions are now in J2000 epoch (whereas all the previous missions
contained Current epoch).
The timescales and localization precisions of the various Notice types
are as follows:

<b>Sequence of Activities</b>
<p>
The sequence of activities for a typical burst follows:<br>

1) The BAT instrument detects a "trigger" (either a "rate trigger" or an "image trigger").<br>
Since many trigger criteria are evaluated every 64 msec,<br>
the one with the largest signal-to-noise significance<br>
(above a minumum acceptable threshold, in that evaluation cycle)<br>
is the one used to select the data interval sent<br>
to the DSP for the image calculation (FFT, Mask_Convolution, InvFFT).<br>
2) This image calculation(s) takes 6-7 sec (or multiples thereof).<br>
3) The image is scanned for a point-source.<br>
If a point-source is found (and it is not a known source (in the BAT on-board catalog)),<br>
then a BAT_POS Notice is sent to TDRSS (and on to GCN and the World).<br>
If a point-source is not found, then the trigger-search task is notified,<br>
and it continues to process more rate data to find a higher-significance trigger criterion.<br>
If it finds one, it sends that data set to the DSP for the same image calculation and pt-source search.<br>
If after ~30 seconds, no position is found, then a BAT_Pos_Nack Notice is generated.<br>
and the BAT instrument goes back into staring and waiting-for-a-new-trigger mode.<br>
This ends the sequence.<br>
In addition to these "rate increase plus image-domain point source" triggers,<br>
there are also image-domain-only triggers.  Every 64 sec, a non-background-subtracted image<br>
is made and searched for point sources tht do not match anything in the on-board catalog.<br>
If one is found, then a BAT_POS Notice is sent to TDRSS (and on to GCN and the World).<br>
4) For all successful triggers, a lightcurve in the standard 4 energy bands<br>
is formed and transmitted through TDRSS.  This is done 3 separate time ranges.<br>
The last one to arrive on the ground (at ~T+186sec) is combined within GCN<br>
with the other 2 previous time segments and distributed.<br>
5) Meanwhile, the FOM has been deciding if the burst is worth observing, and<br>
if the s/c thinks it is safe to slew to the new burst position.<br>
If both are found to be true, then the s/c slews for about 20-75 sec (depends on slew distance).<br>
6) After the slew has settled on target, the NFIs start their standard new_burst<br>
observing sequence.  The XRT takes a quick 0.1or2.5-sec integration<br>
and processes that image on-board looking for a point source.<br>
Any point source in the FOV is assumed to be the burst/afterglow.<br>
It sends that position through TDRSS as the XRT_Position Notice.<br>
If no position is found, then the XRT_Pos_Nack is issued,<br>
and the Image, Spectrum and Lightcurve are always issued.<br>
7) The image accumulated in the previous step is also sent down TDRSS as the XRT Image Notice.<br>
8) After the XRT_Image accumulation, the XRT starts the Spectrum accumulations<br>
(first the LRPD spectrum then the WT spectrum). The durations of the accumulations<br>
depend on the flux of the afterglow source.<br>
9) After the s/c slew has settled on target, the UVOT takes a quick 100-sec integration.<br>
This image is scanned for clusters of pixels above a selectable threshold level.<br>
That list of pixel clusters is transmitted through TDRSS as the UVOT Source List.<br>
10) An 80x80 pixel subarray of that same image is transmitted with full pixel resolution<br>
(ie no thresholding) as the UVOT Image Notice. (The 80x80 pixels may or maynot have pre-binning.<br>
If none, then it is 40x40arcsec, else it is 320x320arcsec.)<br>
11) The UVOT Position Notice is issued after ground-processing and humans have looked<br>
at the TDRSS data products.  If no afterglow is detected, then a UVOT_Pos_Nack is issued.<br>

<p>
The Swift-to-GCN-to-World Procedure:<br>
<u>Notices:</u> GCN receives the Swift messages directly from the Swift spacecraft (through a TDRSS tlm connection),<br>
reformats the messages into the standard GCN_Notice formats, and<br>
distributes them to the sites using the usual distribution methods and filtering.<br>
The total amount of time from the TDRSS transmitter on the s/c to the output port<br>
on the GCN system is in the 1-3 sec range.<br>
<u>Circulars:</u> For each trigger, members from each Instrument team are paged<br>
and respond by dialing into the Burst Response Telecon.<br>
The first decision made in the telcon is: Is this trigger a real GRB?<br>
If it was correctly identified as a known source, then nothing further is done.<br>
If it is a false-positive (noise, etc), then a Retraction Notice and sometimes a Circular are issued.<br>
If it is a real GRB, then an Initial Circular is issued that contains said dcision,<br>
a description of the prompt BAT lightcurve, and improved XRT position and a statement<br>
about x-ray variability (fading, etc), and UVOT information (detection or uppler limit).<br>
All of this is based only on the TDRSS data products.<br>
This <a href=gcn3_archive.html>Circular</a> is issued with 20-40 min after the burst.<br>
Then 1-8 hrs later, after some/all of the full data set (via Malindi) has been received and processed,<br>
a set of 3 "second/refined" Circulars is issued (one from each instrument)<br>
that contains more detailed information about the burst (improved positions, spectral information,<br>
fluence, etc.).<br>
<u>Reports:</u> After all the Swift follow-up observations have been completed (2-10 days),<br>
a <a href=report_archive.html>Report</a> is issued.  This contains slight improvments over the information in the Refined Circulars<br>
plus lightcurves.<br>

<b>Ack, Nack, Update, Retraction</b>
<p>
All 3 instruments have Position Notices (ie RA,Dec locations of the burst, transient, or afterglow).<br>
They come in 4 variations:  Ack,  Nack,  Update,  and  Retraction.<br>
This section describes the contents of these 4 variations and how they are used/occur in practice.<br>
<pre>
ACK          A position was found.<br>
NACK         A position was NOT found.<br>
UPDATE       A revised position was determined (after the initial ACK position).<br>
RETRACTION   The initial identification of a burst/transient/afterglow is no longer true, ie retracting it.
</pre>
<p>
The table below shows which variation from each instrument is produced on-board (ie F for flight)<br>
and which are produced on the ground (G).<br>
<pre>
INST      ACK       NACK      UPDATE      RETRACTION
====      =====     ====      ======      ==========
BAT       F & G      F         G             G

XRT       F & G      F         G             G

UVOT          G      G         G             G
</pre>
Theoretically,  all combinations/sequences of these 4 variations are possible,<br>
but in reality many of those combinations would be too complicated for the recipients to understand<br>
what is really being put forward by the instruments teams.  Hence, after the 2nd issuance,<br>
the description of what is going on with a given trigger will transition over to the Circulars form<br>
for getting the information out to the public.<br>

<b>Formats</b>
<p>
Samples of the E-mail, Cell/Pager, Short-form Cell/Pager, & Subject-only
distribution methods of the 26 GCN/Swift Notice types
are included below.
The format is very similar to the other spacecraft-instrument sources
of GRB locations -- the GCN-standard "TOKEN: value" format.<br>
<p>
The email format has a new feature for the Swift mission -- using email attachments
to actually include the image, spectrum, or lightcurve
in the sending of the email to the recipient.  The recipient can choose which format 
for the attachment: Text, Postscript, GIF, JPEG, PDF, or FITS.  See the table below
for which Notice-types have which attachment-formats.
The attachment technique within GCN works such that you will receive all the various
attachments in the same format. (If you have elected to receive GIF, then all the
images, spectra, and lightcurves will be in the GIF format.  You can not 
get some in GIF and others in FITS.)
<p>
The socket packet contents and format are similar to the other
mission-specific packet types
and are described in detail in the <a href="sock_pkt_def_doc.html">socket
packet definition document</a>. This document also has explanations
of the various fields in the packet (their content, values, and
implications for use),
and those same fields are manifested in the email and cell/pager formats.
(Therefore, it is useful for email/cell/pager recipients to read the 
<a href="sock_pkt_def_doc.html">socket packet definition document</a>
to understand the contents of the email/cell/pager notifications are.)

<b>Filtering</b>
<p>
Sites can elect to receive each of the 29 Swift Notice types on a Notice-by-Notice basis.<br>
There is a separate dis/enable bit for each type.<br>
This filtering applies to all the existing distribution methods/media.<br>
<p>
<a name="tc7"></a>
<b>Error Boxes</b>
<p>
The uncertainty in the location will depend on:<br>
(a) the burst_intensity,<br>
(b) its position in the FOV (only in BAT), and <br>
(c) the relative locations and intensities of other sources in the BAT FOV (BAT positions only).<br>
The typical error is:<br>
1-3 arcmin (diameter, 90% containment) for the BAT_Position Notice,<br>
~7 arcsec (diameter, 90% containment) for on-board generated XRT_Position Notices,<br>
~4 arcsec (diameter, 90% containment) for initial ground-generated XRT_Position Notices,<br>
~3 arcsec (diameter, 90% containment) for ground-generated UVOT-pointing-corrected XRT_Position Notices, and<br>
~2 arcsec (diameter, ??% containment) for the UVOT_Position Notices.<br>
The systematic uncertainty depends on the satellite attitude knowledge
and varies from 0 arcsec to TBD arcsec (diameter) in the worst situations.
The errors quoted in the Position Notices includes only the statistical
contribution.<br>

<b>Test Notices</b>
<p>
To allow sites to "practice" on Swift Notices,
there is Swift Test Notice.  The BAT_GRB_POS_TEST Notice duplicates
the BAT_GRB_POS Notice (all socket packet, email, and cell/page formats).
Sites can elect to receive this Test Notice.
These Test Notices are issued every ~2.8 hours.
The RA,Dec positions rotate through a grid on the Northern & Southern celestial skies.
So far, this is the only "test" version Notice -- none of the 28 other Notices have "test" versions.
<p>

<b>Observing Strategy</b>
<p>
The Swift spacecraft pointing direction (ie FOV) is always known
via the POINTDIR Notices.
It is therefore possible to minimize the slewing time of a ground-based telescope
by having it looking at the RA,Dec listed in the POINTDIR Notices.
Further, the telescope can continuously tile the FOV in a "patrol" mode
all night long thereby obtaining images just prior to the burst.
This is most suitable for automated wide-FOV systems.

<b>Subthreshold Triggers</b>
<p>
Swift-BAT can now trigger on a lower range of image-domain significances.<br>
These are the so-called Subthreshold triggers.<br>
More information can be found <a href="subthreshold.html">here.</a>.<br>
These subthreshold have been discontinued by the Swift Team.<br>
There is also the "sub-sub" threshold locations -- see above.<br>

<b>Recognition</b>
<p>
Sites are encouraged to acknowledge Swift and GCN in their publications
based on follow-up observations using these GCN/Swift locations.

<b>E-mail Examples</b>
<p>
Examples of the 25 Notice types of the e-mail formats are shown below.<br>
The "/////" divider bars are NOT part of the messages.
<p>
Do not take the actual values shown in these examples as real GRBs.<br>
While based on ground-test data from the mission,<br>
they have been adjusted to provide a broader representation<br>
of the various combinations of fields and value ranges.
<p>
For those sites/people that use demons and/or incoming e-mail filters (e.g. procmail),<br>
the "Subject" lines for the all notice types are constant.<br>

<b>Short-form Cell/Pager Examples</b>
<p>
Examples of the short-form pager format are shown below.<br>
There are no "Subject" lines for these e-mails sent to the pager companies,<br>
because the Subject-line would use up valuable character counts<br>
from the maximum displayable for the body of the message.<br>
And it was the very limited display character count of some companies<br>
that motivated the short-form pager method in the first place.<br>
RA,Dec are in B1950 epoch.<br>
